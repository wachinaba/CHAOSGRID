## Introduction

**CHAOSGRID** is a music generator based on chaos theory. It uses the interaction of simple attractors to create chaotic movements of objects, which are then transformed into music. CHAOSGRID generates MIDI signals that can be connected to software synthesizers or other MIDI-compatible instruments for playback.

## Features

- **Chaos Theory Based Movement**: Objects move according to simple attractors, creating unpredictable and complex patterns.
- **MIDI Signal Generation**: Translates object movements into MIDI signals, allowing for versatile music creation.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Observe the dynamic movements and hear the immediate transformation into music.
- **Integration with Synthesizers**: Compatible with various software synthesizers and MIDI instruments for playback.
